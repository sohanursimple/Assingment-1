                <h2>Disease and malnutrition </h2>
                <p>Unsafe water and sanitation can lead to malnutrition or make it worse. “No matter how much food a
                    malnourished child eats, he or she will not get better if the water they are drinking is not safe,”
                    says Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF Director of Emergency Programmes. Unsafe water can cause diarrhoea,
                    which can prevent children from getting the nutrients they need to survive, ultimately leading to
                    malnutrition.</p>

                <h2>Climate change</h2>
                <p>Climate change and extreme weather events like droughts and floods can deplete or contaminate water
                    supplies. This threatens both the quality and the quantity of the water that entire communities rely
                    on. As families in areas of extreme water stress compete for scarce or unsafe water sources, they
                    are driven from their homes, increasing their vulnerability to disease and protection risks.</p>

                <h2>Conflict</h2>
                <p>Conflict is often the main factor driving the threat of famine, putting strain on food and water
                    supplies, as well as health systems. The war in Ukraine, for example, has driven up food and fuel
                    prices in places where children are already going hungry. And all too often, the human dependence on
                    water has been intentionally exploited during armed conflict, with water resources and the systems
                    required to deliver drinking water coming under direct attack.</p>

            <h2>Social Policy </h2>
            <p>Every child has the right to an equitable chance in life
                UNICEF works around the world to reduce child poverty and shield girls and boys from its lifelong
                consequences.</p>
            <p>How governments decide to spend public resources is critical to providing children with the things they
                need to survive and thrive.Across the world, children are more likely to live in poverty than adults.
                They are also more vulnerable
                to its effects. Social protection programmes – like cash transfers, health insurance and education
                subsidies – help give every child an equitable chance in life. They improve children's access to good
                nutrition, health care and education, and reduce the lifelong consequences of poverty. But global
                coverage is low: For almost three out of every four children, social protection remains out of reach.
